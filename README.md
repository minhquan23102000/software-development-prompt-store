# Prompt Store: Software Development Project Templates

A collection of structured templates and guides to support the entire software development lifecycle, with integrated AI assistance tooling.

## Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive set of templates and documents designed to standardize and streamline the software development process. It is particularly optimized for projects utilizing AI assistance tools.

## Repository Structure

- **start-up/**: Templates and guides for project initialization and planning
  - `technical-requirement-document.md`: Template for creating detailed technical requirement documents
  - `system-design-document.md`: Template for system architecture and component design
  - `planner.md`: Development planning template that breaks down work into logical phases
  - `init-codebase-structure.md`: Guidelines for creating optimal, AI-friendly codebase structures
  - `generate-code-base-knowledge.md`: Guide for analyzing and documenting existing codebases

- **cursor/**: Templates for AI agent integration and rules
  - `rules-generation.md`: Templates for generating AI coding agent rules in MDC format
  - **flow/**: Workflow guidance documents for AI development process
    - `READ_PLAN.md`: Guidelines for the reading and planning phases
    - `WRITE.md`: Guidelines for code implementation phase
    - `TEST.md`: Guidelines for testing phase
    - `DOCUMENT.md`: Guidelines for documentation phase

## Purpose

This repository serves multiple purposes:

1. **Standardization**: Provides consistent templates for documenting requirements, system design, and planning
2. **AI Optimization**: Structures documentation in ways that optimize for AI agent assistance
3. **Development Workflow**: Establishes a clear workflow from requirements to implementation
4. **Knowledge Management**: Creates a foundation for maintaining project context and documentation

## How to Use

1. **Project Requirements**: Start with the `technical-requirement-document.md` template to capture and structure project requirements
2. **System Design**: Use the `system-design-document.md` template to create a comprehensive design based on the requirements
3. **Development Planning**: Leverage the `planner.md` template to break the implementation into logical phases with integrated testing
4. **Codebase Structure**: Follow the `init-codebase-structure.md` guidelines to establish an optimal code organization
5. **AI Integration**: Utilize the `rules-generation.md` template to create AI agent rules for consistent coding practices
6. **Existing Codebase Analysis**: Use the `generate-code-base-knowledge.md` guide to create comprehensive documentation for existing projects
7. **Development Workflow**: Follow the structured process in cursor/flow with READ_PLAN → WRITE → TEST → DOCUMENT phases

## Benefits

- Clear traceability from requirements to implementation
- Structured approach to software development
- Optimization for AI-assisted development
- Improved communication between stakeholders
- Consistent documentation standards
- Streamlined workflow with AI-friendly process templates
